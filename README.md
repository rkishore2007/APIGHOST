APIGhost is a stateful, dual-token API security scanner designed to hunt for complex authorization flaws like BOLA/IDOR, BFLA, and Mass Assignment. 

Traditional DAST tools and fuzzers struggle with APIs because they test endpoints in isolation. They fire off GET requests, get a 404 or 403, and move on. APIGhost works differently. It builds a dependency graph of the API, executes requests in stateful chains (Create -> Read -> Delete), and uses two distinct user sessions to mathematically prove when one user can access another user's data.

If the target API doesn't publish an OpenAPI spec, APIGhost ships with a built-in, WAF-resilient crawler to discover endpoints and infer schemas on the fly.

## Features

- **Stateful BOLA Testing**: Automatically strings together `POST` and `GET` requests to test IDORs on real, newly created resources rather than brute-forcing dead IDs.
- **Spec-less Auto-Discovery**: Point APIGhost at a base URL and a wordlist. It will map the attack surface and generate a usable schema automatically.
- **WAF Evasion & Bypasses**: Ships with concurrency limits, jitter, and automated injection of proxy headers (e.g., `X-Forwarded-For`) to bypass weak ACLs.
- **Advanced Logic Flaws**: Automatically tests for HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) and array-wrapping bypasses when standard tests fail.
- **Intelligent Payloads**: Uses pre-fetching and heuristics to inject valid UUIDs, emails, and data types instead of sending malformed junk that just gets blocked by input validation.
- **OWASP API Top 10 Coverage**: Tests for BOLA, BFLA, Mass Assignment, Excessive Data Exposure, Rate Limiting, and Injection (SSTI/SQLi).

## Installation

APIGhost requires Python 3.12+ and can be installed natively.

```bash
# Recommended: Install via pipx to avoid environment conflicts
pipx install git+https://github.com/Arul-AGC/APIGhost.git

# Or standard pip installation
pip install git+https://github.com/Arul-AGC/APIGhost.git
```

## Quick Start

### 1. The Crawler (If you don't have an OpenAPI spec)
Run the crawler against a target to map the API and infer the JSON schemas.

```bash
apighost crawl https://api.example.com wordlists/common_endpoints.txt \
  --output spec.json \
  --token "eyJhbG..." \
  --concurrent 20 \
  --delay 0.5
```

### 2. The Scanner
Run a full stateful scan against the API. You must provide two tokens (User A and User B) to test for BOLA.

```bash
apighost scan https://api.example.com \
  --spec spec.json \
  --token-a "UserA_Token" \
  --token-b "UserB_Token" \
  --auth-mode bearer \
  --aggressive
```
